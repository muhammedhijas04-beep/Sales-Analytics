
📊 Power BI Sales & Profit Dashboard – Multi-Market Business Intelligence (India)

🚀 Business Performance Analytics | Revenue | Profitability | Market Insights

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end business intelligence dashboard built using Power BI to analyze multi-market sales and profit performance across India from 2017 to 2021.

It simulates a real-world retail & distribution business environment and helps leadership teams answer:

Where is revenue coming from?
Which markets generate profit and which destroy it?
Who are the most valuable customers?
Which products drive growth?

The dashboard enables data-driven decision making through interactive visuals, KPI tracking, and deep drill-downs.

🎯 Business Problem

A retail distribution company operating across multiple Indian cities faces:

Declining profit margins

Uneven market performance

Poor visibility into customer profitability

No centralized reporting system

Leadership needs a single source of truth to monitor performance and take corrective action.

💡 Solution

I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides:

Executive-level KPIs

Market-wise revenue & profit tracking

Customer & product performance analysis

Trend forecasting and target tracking

Loss-making region detection

This turns raw sales data into actionable business intelligence.
